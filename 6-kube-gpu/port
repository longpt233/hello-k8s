30000-32767 	Default port range for NodePort Services. Typically, these ports would need to be exposed to external load-balancers, or other external consumers of the application itself.

Any port numbers marked with * are overridable, so you will need to ensure any custom ports you provide are also open.

Although etcd ports are included in master nodes, you can also host your own etcd cluster externally on custom ports.

The pod network plugin you use (see below) may also require certain ports to be open. Since this differs with each pod network plugin, please see the documentation for the plugins about what port(s) those need.
